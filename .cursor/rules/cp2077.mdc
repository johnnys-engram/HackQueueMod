# CP2077 v1.63 VERSION LOCK - HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Game: CP2077 v1.63 ONLY (never 2.0+)
- redscript: 0.5.14 exactly
- CET: 1.25.2, RED4ext: 1.15.0, TweakXL: 1.2.1, ArchiveXL: 1.5.11
- Do not use terminal commands unless instructed directly.

# ARCHITECTURE HIERARCHY (Follow Plan's Stack)
1. redscript 0.5.14 (preferred) - core logic, stats, persistence
2. RED4ext 1.15.0 - only when redscript lacks engine access  
3. CET 1.25.2 - runtime overlays, debug only (NOT core logic)
4. TweakXL 1.2.1 - static data changes only
5. ArchiveXL 1.5.11 - UI/assets only

# MANDATORY SAFETY PATTERNS
- Null check EVERY Game.GetPlayer(), vehicle, world object interaction
- Log all hook attempts: LogChannel("ModName", "Hook attempt: " + className)
- Version gate at startup with pin verification
- No heavy logic in CET onUpdate loops - throttle with timers
- ImGui Begin/End calls must be balanced
- Unique hotkey IDs only

# EVIDENCE-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION
- Verify every class/method exists in 1.63 source before coding
- Many 2.0+ patterns DO NOT work in 1.63
- Use community modding as a resource for 1.63 quirks
- Reference 1.63 mod examples in project folder and vanilla behavior patterns
- When uncertain about 1.63 syntax/behavior, research first, then implement

# BLOAT CONTROL DURING IMPLEMENTATION
- Each framework must solve specific 1.63 as designed

# EXECUTION DISCIPLINE
- Understand full scope before coding
- Thoughtful implementation over rapid iteration in this constraining environment
- Always implement risk assessment

# YOUR ROLE: SENIOR AI DEVELOPER
- You implement execution plans created by the Mod Architect
- Focus on clean, working implementation of the provided technical design
- Ask clarifying questions when plans are unclear, don't guess

# WHEN TO ASK THE ARCHITECT
- If execution plan steps are ambiguous or incomplete
- When encountering 1.63-specific limitations not covered in the plan
- If implementation reveals architectural issues with the design
- Before adding any dependencies not specified in the plan
- When rollback strategy needs clarification
